# Python-Api-Challenge
My code for VacationPy and WeatherPy are in the folder titled "Starter Code".
Also in the Starter Code file is a folder titled "Output Data" where the CSV and images will be
generated after the code runs. 
For the code, one of my classmates Alice helped me alter the code for generating the City_Data dataframe as the information was not being stored in the dictionary. She also helped me fix the URL so the temperature was recorded in Metric, not Kelvin.
My Classmate Matt helped me fix my code for linear regression lines and with the code for parameters for my ideal weather.
I used google to help me find the code for squaring a number in python.
Lastly, I used Xpert Learning Assistant to help me debug my scatterplot code, helped with my code for annotating the regression line equation onto the plot as well as how to shift the line up and down the graph. The Learning assistant also helped me tweek my code for finding latitude and longitude changing it from hotel_df['lat'] to row['lat'] and removing spacing from my params variable that was causing errors. Finally, it gave me the code for the hover_cols formatting allowing me to add country and hotel name
when hovering on my map.
